RandomList
==========
This is a C# console application which generates a list of numbers from 1 to an internally-specified bound in random orders.
It works in O(n) time, assuming that array read/write access time is constant, and it utilizes O(n) space to store the array.

To run the application, download the ZIP file and access RandomList-master. Open RandomList/RandomList.sln to open the project in Visual Studo. If the source code does not autopopulate the IDE, click FILE->Open File->Program.cs. Then hit F5 to build and run the code.
